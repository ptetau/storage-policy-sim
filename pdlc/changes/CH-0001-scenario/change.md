# CH-0001 · Seasonal sun, daily weather and household load

Intent: IN-0001 · Scope: CAP-scenario · Status: building · Ticket: none · Branch: pdlc/CH-0001-scenario · Base: main

Tests-Locked: 5de000a

## Delivers

The library gives the hours of a scenario. Each hour has a solar output from the season,
the sun height and a seeded daily sky. Each hour also has a base load and a flexible load.

## Requirements

### CAP-scenario.R1 · Seasonal sun

- Given latitude 45, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then day 171 gives more than twice the output of day 354.
- Given latitude -41, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then day 354 gives more than twice the output of day 171.
- Given latitude 0, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then the outputs of day 171 and day 354 differ by less than 1%.
- Given latitude 45, when the sky is sunny at 00:00 on day 171, then the output is 0 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when each hour of days 0 to 364 is sunny, then each output is from 0 to 5 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 at 12:00 on day 171, when the sky is cloudy, then the output is 0.5 times the sunny output. The tolerance is 0.001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 at 12:00 on day 171, when the sky is overcast, then the output is 0.15 times the sunny output. The tolerance is 0.001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 and 0 kW of panels, when the sky is sunny at 12:00 on day 171, then the output is 0 kWh.

### CAP-scenario.R2 · Daily weather

- Given seed 7 and latitude 45, when the scenario runs two times for 365 days, then the two runs give the same hours.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs 365 days with seed 7 and with seed 8, then the skies differ on at least 50 days.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then it gives 8760 hours in order of day, then hour.
- Given seed 7 and 0 days, when the scenario runs, then it gives no hours.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then the 24 hours of each day have the same sky.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then each solar output equals R1 (seasonal sun) for its day, hour and sky. The tolerance is 0.000001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when seeds 1 to 20 run 365 days, then December to February has over twice the overcast days of June to August.
- Given latitude -41, when seeds 1 to 20 run 365 days, then June to August has over twice the overcast days of December to February.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then 60% or more of days 1 to 364 keep the previous sky.
- Given seed 7 and 730 days, when the scenario runs, then day 365 is day 0 of the year. Day 729 is day 364 of the year.

### CAP-scenario.R3 · Household load

- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs 365 days, then the total load is 7300 kWh. The tolerance is 0.1 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then the base load of day 15 is 1.45 to 1.55 times the base load of day 197.
- Given latitude -41, when the scenario runs, then the base load of day 197 is 1.45 to 1.55 times the base load of day 15.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then on day 100 the base load at 19:00 is more than at 13:00.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then on day 100 the base load at 07:00 is more than at 03:00.
- Given 3 kWh of flexible load, when the scenario runs 365 days, then each day has 1 kWh of it at 18:00, 19:00 and 20:00. Each other hour has 0 kWh.
- Given 0 kWh of flexible load, when the scenario runs 365 days, then each hour has 0 kWh of flexible load.
- Given latitude 45, when seed 7 and seed 8 each run 365 days, then each hour has the same base and flexible load.

## Relies on

- DES-errors (conventions to follow)
- DES-writing-style (conventions to follow)
- DES-pdlc-check-tagging (conventions to follow)
- DES-lean-checks (conventions to follow)

## Interface

All entries are in the namespace `StoragePolicySim`, in `StoragePolicySim/Scenario.lean`. A
check imports `StoragePolicySim.Scenario` and opens `StoragePolicySim`. No entry can fail,
so no entry has an error code.

- `inductive Sky | sunny | cloudy | overcast` with `BEq`, `Repr` and `Inhabited` (assumed).
- `Sky.factor : Sky → Float`: 1.0 for `sunny`, 0.5 for `cloudy`, and 0.15 for `overcast`.
- `structure Site` with `Repr` and `Inhabited` (assumed). The fields are these:
  - `latitude : Float`: degrees, south is negative.
  - `pvKw : Float`: the kW of the panels.
  - `dailyLoadKwh : Float`: the load of a day, with the flexible load included.
  - `flexKwh : Float`: the part of the daily load that a strategy can move.
- `structure Hour` with `Repr` and `Inhabited` (assumed). The fields are these:
  - `day : Nat`: the day of the run, from 0.
  - `dayOfYear : Nat`: `day % 365`, from 0 (1 January) to 364.
  - `hour : Nat`: the hour of the day, from 0 to 23. Hour 12 is 12:00 to 13:00.
  - `sky : Sky`: the sky of the day.
  - `pvKwh : Float`: the solar energy of the hour.
  - `baseLoadKwh : Float`: the base load of the hour.
  - `flexKwh : Float`: the flexible load of the hour, at its default hours.
- `pvOutput (site : Site) (dayOfYear hour : Nat) (sky : Sky) : Float` gives the solar energy
  of one hour in kWh. It reads only `latitude` and `pvKw` of the site.
- `scenario (site : Site) (seed days : Nat) : Array Hour` gives `24 × days` hours, in order of
  day, then hour. The same arguments give the same array.

### Test seams

- randomness: the `seed` argument of `scenario`. The same seed gives the same skies.
- clock: none, because no line depends on the real date or time.

## Progress log

- Planned as the first change of IN-0001 (solar self-consumption simulator), because each other change uses its hours.
- The builder found that `tests/CAP-scenario.lean` does not compile. `fun c => c.name` needs the type `Check` in Lean 4.35.0. The check goes back to the test writer, round 1 of 2.
- `lake build` writes `lake-manifest.json`. The file goes into "Files" (assumed), so that the build is the same each time.
- After the fix, the 34 checks of `tests/CAP-scenario.lean` pass on the code of the builder. App code exists after a send-back, so a pass is permitted.
- Build: the 34 checks of `tests/CAP-scenario.lean` pass. No check changed since the lock `5de000a`.
- Verify round 1: quality and specification failed. The follow-ups of security (a cap on days, and large seeds) need no intent, because JOB-simulate.R5 (bad command line) limits `--days` and `--seed`.
- Verify returned the change to build, because two local names in `scenario` were not clear.
- The builder renamed the array of the day skies to `daySkies`, and the sky of one day to `sky`. The 34 checks pass.
- Verify round 2: specification failed on the words of three log lines. Verify corrected the words, and no code changed.
- Verify round 3: specification failed, because two log lines did not agree on the count of names. The user chose to correct the words and review again.
