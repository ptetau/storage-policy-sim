# CAP-scenario · Hourly sun, weather and household load for a site

Status: active

## What it is for

CAP-scenario (sun, weather and load) makes the world that a strategy must deal with, one hour at a time. It gives
the solar output of each hour from the season and the sun height, and a daily sky from a
seeded weather model. It also gives the household load of each hour, with a seasonal base
load and a flexible load that a strategy can move.

## Requirements

### CAP-scenario.R1 · Seasonal sun

Status: ready · Intents: IN-0001

The output of an hour is the panel power, times the sine of the sun height, times the sky
factor (assumed). The sun height uses the latitude, the day of the year, and the middle of
the hour in solar time (assumed).

The declination is 23.44 degrees times sin(2π × (285 + day) / 365), where day 0 is 1 January
(assumed). The sky factor is 1.0 for sunny, 0.5 for cloudy, and 0.15 for overcast (assumed).
When the sun is below the horizon, the output is 0. In these lines, the site has 5 kW of panels,
unless the line says otherwise.

- Given latitude 45, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then day 171 gives more than twice the output of day 354.
- Given latitude -41, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then day 354 gives more than twice the output of day 171.
- Given latitude 0, when the sky is sunny at 12:00, then the outputs of day 171 and day 354 differ by less than 1%.
- Given latitude 45, when the sky is sunny at 00:00 on day 171, then the output is 0 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when each hour of days 0 to 364 is sunny, then each output is from 0 to 5 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 at 12:00 on day 171, when the sky is cloudy, then the output is 0.5 times the sunny output. The tolerance is 0.001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 at 12:00 on day 171, when the sky is overcast, then the output is 0.15 times the sunny output. The tolerance is 0.001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45 and 0 kW of panels, when the sky is sunny at 12:00 on day 171, then the output is 0 kWh.

### CAP-scenario.R2 · Daily weather

Status: ready · Intents: IN-0001

A seed and a number of days give one sky for each day, and the same hours each time. The
scenario starts on 1 January and gives the hours in order of day, then hour.

Each day keeps the sky of the day before with a chance of 0.6 (assumed). Else, the day takes
a new sky from the chances of its half of the year (assumed):

- Summer half: sunny 0.55, cloudy 0.30, overcast 0.15 (assumed).
- Winter half: sunny 0.20, cloudy 0.35, overcast 0.45 (assumed).

The summer half is days 90 to 272 of each year at latitude 0 or more, and the other days at
a negative latitude (assumed). After day 364, the day of the year starts again at 0.

- Given seed 7 and latitude 45, when the scenario runs two times for 365 days, then the two runs give the same hours.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs 365 days with seed 7 and with seed 8, then the skies differ on at least 50 days.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then it gives 8760 hours in order of day, then hour.
- Given seed 7 and 0 days, when the scenario runs, then it gives no hours.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then the 24 hours of each day have the same sky.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then each solar output equals R1 (seasonal sun) for its day, hour and sky. The tolerance is 0.000001 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when seeds 1 to 20 run 365 days, then December to February has over twice the overcast days of June to August.
- Given latitude -41, when seeds 1 to 20 run 365 days, then June to August has over twice the overcast days of December to February.
- Given seed 7 and 365 days, when the scenario runs, then 60% or more of days 1 to 364 keep the previous sky.
- Given seed 7 and 730 days, when the scenario runs, then day 365 is day 0 of the year. Day 729 is day 364 of the year.

### CAP-scenario.R3 · Household load

Status: ready · Intents: IN-0001

The daily load includes the flexible load. The base load is the daily load less the flexible
load, spread over the hours by a fixed profile (assumed).

The profile has a morning peak and an evening peak (assumed). A seasonal factor of
1 + 0.2 × cos(2π × (day - peak) / 365) scales the base load (assumed). The peak is day 15 at
latitude 0 or more, and day 197 at a negative latitude (assumed).

By default, the flexible load uses equal parts at 18:00, 19:00 and 20:00 (assumed). The load
does not depend on the seed. In these lines, the daily load is 20 kWh with 3 kWh flexible,
unless the line says otherwise.

- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs 365 days, then the total load is 7300 kWh. The tolerance is 0.1 kWh.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then the base load of day 15 is 1.45 to 1.55 times the base load of day 197.
- Given latitude -41, when the scenario runs, then the base load of day 197 is 1.45 to 1.55 times the base load of day 15.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then on day 100 the base load at 19:00 is more than at 13:00.
- Given latitude 45, when the scenario runs, then on day 100 the base load at 07:00 is more than at 03:00.
- Given 3 kWh of flexible load, when the scenario runs 365 days, then each day has 1 kWh of it at 18:00, 19:00 and 20:00. Each other hour has 0 kWh.
- Given 0 kWh of flexible load, when the scenario runs 365 days, then each hour has 0 kWh of flexible load.
- Given latitude 45, when seed 7 and seed 8 each run 365 days, then each hour has the same base and flexible load.
